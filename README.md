1. Introduction

   - Hey, have you ever struggled to find relevant discussions about a specific problem on Reddit?
   - Yeah, I've been there too. That's why I came up with this tool to help us out. It's a command-line tool that lets you mark posts and get notified when similar ones appear in the future.

   - What's the main idea behind this tool?
   - Well, it's all about making our lives easier when browsing Reddit. We can mark posts we find interesting and get notified when new ones come up. It's like having a virtual assistant keeping an eye on the discussions we care about.

   - How does it work, exactly?
   - You'll be able to mark posts as positive or negative examples, and the tool will store them locally. When a new post matching your examples appears, you'll get a real-time notification.

   - How do we start using it?
   - The next section will guide you through the installation and setup process.

   - And what about the technical details?
   - Don't worry, I'll explain all the nitty-gritty details in the following sections.
