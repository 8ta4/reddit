## Introduction

- What is this tool all about?
    - This tool is a game-changer for Reddit marketing. It lets you find Reddit posts that talk about a problem that your product can solve. You just need to mark a post from the past and the tool will keep an eye on new posts that are similar to it. When it finds one, it will let you know so you can jump in and show off your product.

- How does it work?
    - It uses some fancy stuff like natural language processing and machine learning to understand what Reddit posts are saying and how they relate to your product. You can mark posts as positive or negative examples to teach the tool what kind of posts you are looking for. The tool will then score the posts based on how similar they are to your examples and notify you when there is a match.
