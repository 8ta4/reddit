1. Introduction

   - What's the main goal of this tool?
   - The idea is to simplify our Reddit experience. With this tool, we can mark interesting posts and get notified when new, similar ones appear. It's like having a personal assistant keeping track of the discussions that matter to us.

2. Features Overview

   - So, what does this tool do exactly?
   - You know how we sometimes find interesting posts on Reddit and wish we could get notified when similar ones come up? This tool does that. It lets you mark posts and keeps an eye on similar discussions for you.

   - How do I tell the tool what kind of posts I'm interested in?
   - You can provide positive and negative examples. Positive examples are posts that are relevant to your product, while negative examples are posts that are not.

   - Will it look for similar posts in any subreddit, or just the ones I'm interested in?
   - The tool focuses on the same subreddit as your positive examples.

   - Where does the tool store the examples I provide?
   - It stores them locally, so you don't have to worry about external storage or services. You can keep track of your examples right on your computer.

   - How do I mark a post as a positive or negative example?
   - Just provide the post's URL along with a flag specifying the type of example.
